				</header>
				<p>“Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-45" id="noteref-45" epub:type="noteref">45</a> “I am Thy servant; O give me understanding, that I may know Thy testimonies. Incline my heart unto the words of Thy mouth.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-46" id="noteref-46" epub:type="noteref">46</a> “Let thy speech distil as the dew.” The children of Israel spake in old time to Moses, “Speak thou unto us and we will hear, but let not the Lord speak unto us lest we die.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-47" id="noteref-47" epub:type="noteref">47</a> Not thus, O Lord, not thus do I pray, but rather with Samuel the prophet, I beseech Thee humbly and earnestly, “Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth.” Let not Moses speak to me, nor any prophet, but rather speak Thou, O Lord, who didst inspire and illuminate all the prophets; for Thou alone without them canst perfectly fill me with knowledge, whilst they without Thee shall profit nothing.</p>
				<p>They can indeed utter words, but they give not the spirit. They speak with exceeding beauty, but when Thou art silent they kindle not the heart. They give us scriptures, but Thou makest known the sense thereof. They bring us mysteries, but Thou revealest the things which are signified. They utter commandments, but Thou helpest to the fulfilling of them. They show the way, but Thou givest strength for the journey. They act only outwardly, but Thou dost instruct and enlighten the heart. They water, but Thou givest the increase. They cry with words, but Thou givest understanding to the hearer.</p>
				<p>Therefore let not Moses speak to me, but Thou, O Lord my God, Eternal Truth; lest I die and bring forth no fruit, being outwardly admonished, but not enkindled within; lest the word heard but not followed, known but not loved, believed but not obeyed, rise up against me in the judgment. “Speak, Lord, for Thy servant heareth;” “Thou hast the words of eternal life.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-48" id="noteref-48" epub:type="noteref">48</a> Speak unto me for some consolation unto my soul, for the amendment of my whole life, and for the praise and glory and eternal honour of Thy Name.</p>
